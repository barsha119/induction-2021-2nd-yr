Using Node js I have made a Qoutes API 
- This API takes two parameter :
- First one is Number of qoutes that you want to see.
- Second is the Category you want : Inspirational or Funny.

                               
<br><br>**To host the program go through the following steps.**<br>

- In the terminal go to the folder [Barsha Baishaki Nayak](../induction-2021-2nd-yr/BackendDevelopmentusingNode/TaskSubmission/BarshaBaishakiNayak)
- Install Nodemon and run nodemon qoutes.js
- Now in your browser, search : <br>
   - e.g:  <br>
              1. For 3 number of qoutes, search [http://localhost:3000/qoutes/number?num=3](http://localhost:3000/qoutes/number?num=3)<br>
              2. For 10 number of qoutes, search [http://localhost:3000/qoutes/number?num=3](http://localhost:3000/qoutes/number?num=10)<br>
              3. For Inspirational qoutes, search [http://localhost:3000/qoutes/number?num=3](http://localhost:3000/qoutes/catregory?cat=inspirational)<br>
              4. For Funny qoutes, search [http://localhost:3000/qoutes/number?num=3](http://localhost:3000/qoutes/catregory?cat=funny)<br>
