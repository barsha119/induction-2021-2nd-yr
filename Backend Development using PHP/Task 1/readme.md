## Problem Statement

Build a `Quotes API` using PHP. <br>

- Endpoint should take minimum **Two** number of **Query**.
- Query Parameters :
  - Number of Quotes : To return a specified number of quotes.
  - Category of Quotes : To return  quotes from the following categories.
    - Inspirational quotes.
    - Funny quotes.
- The `API` should return **`JSON`** data.
  - e.g <br>
  > {<br>
"quote" : "This is a quote",<br>
"category" : "Funny"<br>
}

#### Do's and Don'ts
- **Do** : You can use raw JSON data to populate your database. <br>
- **Don't** :  Don't use prebuild APIs to create endpoints or redirect your Server to the Third party APIs.
